<h1>Tips and Tricks to Improve Your Finances</h1>
<p><b>1. Use cash. </b>Spending cash makes the spending more real, and there's an added advantage of knowing when you're out of cash, instead of spending more than you have.</p>
<p><b>2. Build an emergency fund. </b>It can make a lot of difference. Low-income families with an emergency fund are better off financially than moderate-income families with less saved up.</p>
<p><b>3. Stay home </b>Going out makes you spend more than necessary. You go to the mall, eat at restaurants. It's hard to avoid spending when you're on the road. Instead, find free entertainment at home and bond with your family.</p>
<p><b>4. Save automatically </b>Setting up automatic savings is the easiest and most effective way to save, and it puts extra cash out of sight and out of mind. Every pay day, have your employer deduct a certain amount from your paycheck and transfer it to a retirement or savings account. Or every month, have your bank or credit union transfer a fixed amount from your checking account to a savings or investment account.</p>
<p><b>5. Don't get catalogs. </b>Or emailed promotions from companies trying to sell you stuff. Their announcements of sales or cool new products make it very tempting to buy something you don't need. Stop the catalogs and you'll spend less.</p>
<p><b>6. Use the 24 hour rule. </b>This rules helps avoid purchasing expensive or unnecessary items on impulse. Think over each nonessential purchase for at least 24 hours. This is particularly easy to do while shopping online, because you can add items to your cart or wish list and come back to them a day later.</p>
